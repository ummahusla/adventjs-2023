# Santa's CyberTruck

### Description

Santa ðŸŽ… is testing his new electric sled, the CyberReindeer, on a North Pole road. The road is represented by a string of characters, where:

- `.` = Road
- `S` = Santa's Sled
- `*` = Open barrier
- `|` = Closed barrier
Example of a road: `S...|....|.....`

Each unit of time, the sled moves one position to the right. If it encounters a closed barrier, it stops until the barrier opens. If it is open, it goes through directly.

All barriers start closed, but after 5 units of time, they all open forever.

Create a function that simulates the sled's movement for a given time and returns an array of strings representing the state of the road at each unit of time:

```js
const road = 'S..|...|..'
const time = 10 // units of time
const result = cyberReindeer(road, time)

/* -> result:
[
  'S..|...|..', // initial state
  '.S.|...|..', // sled advances on the road
  '..S|...|..', // sled advances on the road
  '..S|...|..', // sled stops at the barrier
  '..S|...|..', // sled stops at the barrier
  '...S...*..', // barrier opens, sled advances
  '...*S..*..', // sled advances on the road
  '...*.S.*..', // sled advances on the road
  '...*..S*..', // sled advances on the road
  '...*...S..', // passes through the open barrier
]
*/
```

The result is an array where each element shows the road at each unit of time.

Take into account that if the sled is in the same position as a barrier, then it takes its place in the array.

The elves were inspired by this Code Wars challenge.

### Solution

```js
function cyberReindeer(road, time) {
  const result = [];
  let trip = road.split('');
  let step = 0;
  let isBarrier = false;

  for(let i = 0; i < time; i++) {
    if(i === 5) {
      trip = trip.join("").replaceAll("|", "*").split("");
    }

    if(i !== 0) {
      const nextStep = step + 1;

      if(trip[nextStep] === '.') {
        trip[step] = isBarrier ? '*' : '.';
        isBarrier = false;
        trip[nextStep] = 'S';
        step++;
      } else if (trip[nextStep] === '*') {
        trip[step] = isBarrier ? '*' : '.';
        trip[nextStep] = 'S';
        isBarrier = true;
        step++;
      }
    }

    result.push(trip.join(''));
  }

  return result;
}
```

### Results

```
1,364 ops/s (Higher is better)
Cognitive complexity: 8 (Lower is better)
